Eat a burger.

1. To eat a burger, find a burger on the left hand column that sounds good to you. Click "Eat."

2. The eaten burger will move the colum on the left.

3. To add a burger to the "un-eaten" column, navigate to the "Add a Burger Already" form at the bottom of the page. Type the type of burger you want to eat and click "Add Burger."  Your new burger should show up in the left hand column. Eat it like the others. Or don't.

*The "add a burger here" field sometimes takes a few clicks to know you are there.
